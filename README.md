# Movie Statitics Grapher
Project for David C. Chiu's CSCI455 databases course at The University of Puget Sound.

Written by Branson Jones, Matilda Lerner, and Riley Schuller using data available at https://datasets.imdbws.com/

### To run the program
Execute main.py through python!

### Installing an updated dataset
We've provided a lite version of the IMDb dataset (at the time of development). However, if you want to work with the full dataset - or install an updated version - follow these steps:
 1. Go to https://datasets.imdbws.com/ 
 2. Install, extract, and rename the following files:
    - name.basics.tsv.gz -> Basics.tsv
    - title.akas.tsv.gz -> Akas.tsv
    - title.basics.tsv.gz -> Title_Basics.tsv
    - title.episode.tsv.gz -> Episode.tsv
    - title.principals.tsv.gz -> Principals.tsv
    - title.ratings.tsv.gz -> Ratings.tsv
 3. Put extracted / renamed files into the data filepath
 4. Yay! :)
PLEASE NOTE: the full dataset weighs about 6gb, which is a lot! Be careful when installing.
